    <main><h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Entertrained, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
<h3 id="who-we-are-and-what-this-policy-covers">Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>We are Entertrained (aka. Entertrained.app), owned by Appstrakcja Maciej Caderek.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use our website. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
<h3 id="creative-commons-sharealike-license">Creative Commons Sharealike License</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You&#39;re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices. If you do use it, we&#39;d appreciate a credit and link to Entertrained somewhere on your site.</p>
<p>The text of the policy is based on the work of folks at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, shared under the same license. You can grab a copy of the original text from their <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic/blob/master/Privacy-Policy.md">Github repository</a>.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>
<p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let&#39;s go over the information that we collect.</p>
<h4 id="information-you-provide-to-us"><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
<p>It&#39;s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Basic account information: **We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Entertrained.app account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name — and that&#39;s it. You may provide us with more information, but we don&#39;t require that information to create a Entertrained.app account.</li>
<li><strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have a Entertrained.app account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an &quot;About Me&quot; description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>
<li><strong>Payment and contact information:</strong> If you buy something from us — a subscription to a Entertrained.app plan or other premium features, you&#39;ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you&#39;ve made. You may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.</li>
<li><strong>Content information:</strong> We collect information about the books and other texts that you use, including any custom uploaded texts. This helps us provide better suggestions for further typing or reading, enhancing your experience on our platform.</li>
<li>**Communications with us (hi there!): **You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Customer Service about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, Entertrained.app comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-automatically"><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on Entertrained.app.</li>
<li><strong>Transactional information:</strong> When you make a purchase through our Services, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and the date and location of the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our Entertrained.app services — in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [Entertrained.app username] deleted &quot;[custom book title]&quot; at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, features enabled for your website, along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>
<li><strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
<li><strong>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Entertrained uses cookies and other technologies to help us identify and track visitors, and usage of our service. LocalStorage is a web storage API that allows us to store key-value pairs in a web browser. The data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, making it suitable for storing data that needs to be available across sessions. We use localStorage to store user session information. IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing significant amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It provides a way to store and retrieve objects that are indexed with a key, enabling high-performance searches and retrievals. We use IndexedDB to store user preferences, statistics and progress, and to cache book information for quick access and better performance. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources"><em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Party Login:</strong> If you create or log in to your Entertrained.app account through another service (like Google) we&#39;ll receive associated login information (e.g. a connection token, your username, your email address)</li>
<li><strong>Financial Account Info**</strong>: **If you use our premium account, we&#39;ll receive your payment information from Stripe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>
<p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-we-use-information">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
<h4 id="purposes-for-using-information"><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>
<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, backup and restore your data, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>
<li><strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them practice more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>To place and manage ads in our advertising program.</strong> For example, to place ads on our website as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.</li>
<li><strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>
<li><strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of Entertrained and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>
<li><strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
<li><strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content, and providing new texts for your reading pleasure and typing practice.</li>
<li><strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Entertrained. If you don&#39;t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we&#39;ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="legal-bases-for-collecting-and-using-information"><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></h4>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
<p>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or</p>
<p>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</p>
<p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</p>
<p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or</p>
<p>(5) You have given us your consent — for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our <a href="http://www.automattic.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-information">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4 id="how-we-share-information"><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>
<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below, as well as in the section called <a href="/privacy/#ads-and-analytics-services-provided-by-others">Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers our subscription plans and ither premium features, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider; those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our team); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
<li><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Entertrained, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
<li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Entertrained goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-shared-publicly"><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly.</p>
<p>That means information like your public profile, comments, and other content that you make public on our website.</p>
<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-we-keep-information">How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when it&#39;s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we&#39;re not legally required to keep it.</p>
<p>For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Entertrained&#39;s websites, like the visitor&#39;s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Entertrained&#39;s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>
<p>As another example, when you delete a post, or comment from your Entertrained.app account, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.</p>
<h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium account — may not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, Entertrained does not respond to &quot;do not track&quot; signals across all of our Services. However, you can <a href="/cookies/#controlling-cookies">usually choose</a> to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Entertrained&#39;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Entertrained&#39;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Opt out of our internal analytics program:</strong> You can do this through your user settings. By opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you&#39;re logged in to your Entertrained.app account. For more information, please see our <a href="/cookies/#our-internal-analytics-tool">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Close your account:</strong> While we&#39;d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h3>
<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including some US states and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the &quot;GDPR&quot;), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>
<h4 id="european-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr"><em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em></h4>
<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
<h4 id="us-privacy-laws"><em>US Privacy Laws</em></h4>
<p>Laws in some US states require us to provide residents with additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. You&#39;ll find that information in this section (if you are a California resident, please note that this is the Notice at Collection we are required to provide you under California law).</p>
<p>In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information, depending on the Services used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>
<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>
<li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);</li>
<li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>
<li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);</li>
<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the <a href="/privacy/#information-we-collect">Information We Collect section</a> above.</p>
<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the <a href="/privacy/#how-and-why-we-use-information">How and Why We Use Information section</a>. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the <a href="/privacy/#sharing-information">Sharing Information section</a>. We retain this information for the length of time described in our <a href="/privacy/#how-long-we-keep-information">How Long We Keep Information section</a>.</p>
<p>In some US states you have additional rights subject to any exemptions provided by your state&#39;s respective law, including the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request a copy of the specific pieces of information we collect about you and, if you&#39;re in California, to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, and the categories of third parties we share it with;</li>
<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
<li>Request correction of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
<li>Opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information;</li>
<li>Receive a copy of your information in a readily portable format; and</li>
<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Right to Opt Out</em></strong></p>
<p>We never directly sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).</p>
<p>We may share your information as necessary with our third-party service providers to provide our services to you. To the extent that we share your information with certain advertising, marketing, or analytics vendors, this can be considered a &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;share&quot; in certain U.S. States, which you may have the right to opt out of.</p>
<!-- You can learn more about this sharing and how to opt out by clicking the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link in the footer of our websites, or from the settings page within our apps. Note that in some instances this link will only display to individuals visiting our sites from within the relevant states. -->
<!---->
<!-- Our opt-out is managed through cookies, so if you delete cookies, your browser is set to delete cookies automatically after a certain length of time, or if you visit sites in a different browser, you'll need to make this selection again. -->
<!---->
<!-- We also respect the GPC browser signal and will treat it as a valid means of communicating your desire to opt out. -->

<p>We do not collect or process your sensitive (and potentially sensitive) personal information except where it is strictly necessary to provide you with our service, where the processing is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or for other purposes that do not require an option to limit under California law. We don&#39;t knowingly sell or share personal information of those under 16.</p>
<!-- **_Your Information & Personalized Advertising_** -->
<!---->
<!-- Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible. We show ads on some of our users' sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn't become an obstacle to having a voice. Our ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites. As part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users' sites and some of our own. -->
<!---->
<!-- The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a "sale" or "share" of information under some US state privacy laws. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. Learn how you can opt out by going to[ Advertising on Entertrained.app Sites and Sites in the WordAds Program](https://wordpress.com/advertising-program-optout/). -->

<h4 id="contacting-us-about-these-rights"><em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em></h4>
<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren&#39;t able to or you&#39;d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to &quot;<a href="/privacy/#how-to-reach-us">How to Reach Us</a>&quot; to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>
<p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we&#39;ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything. For example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization. We may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>
<!-- done -->

<h4 id="_appeals-process-for-rights-requests-denials_"><strong><em>Appeals Process for Rights Requests Denials</em></strong></h4>
<p>In some circumstances we may deny your request to exercise one of these rights. For example, if we cannot verify that you are the account owner we may deny your request to access the personal information associated with your account. As another example, if we are legally required to maintain a copy of your personal information we may deny your request to delete your personal information.</p>
<p>In the event that we deny your request, we will communicate this fact to you in writing. You may appeal our decision by responding in writing to our denial email and stating that you would like to appeal. In the event that your appeal is also denied this information will be communicated to you in writing.</p>
<p>If your appeal is denied, in some US states you may refer the denied appeal to the state attorney general if you believe the denial is in conflict with your legal rights. The process for how to do this will be communicated to you in writing at the same time we send you our decision about your appeal.</p>
