<p><em>Last Updated: September 14, 2024</em></p>
<h3 id="the-gist">The Gist</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service (”Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions. <strong>If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a user in countries located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (“European User”), some special terms apply to you as mentioned below.</p>
<h3 id="creative-commons-sharealike-license">Creative Commons Sharealike License</h3>
<p>We’ve made these Terms available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike license</a>, which means that you’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise them so that your Terms of Service reflect your actual practices. Also, if you do use these Terms, we’d appreciate a credit and link to Entertrained.app somewhere on your website. You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The text of the terms is based on the work of folks at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, shared under the same license. You can grab a copy of the original text from their <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic/blob/master/Terms%20of%20Service/WordPress.com/EN-Terms-of-Service.md">Github repository</a>.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-service-1">Terms of Service</h3>
<p>These Terms govern your access to and use of the software, applications, extensions, and other products and services we provide through or for <a href="https://entertrained.app/">Entertrained.app</a> (our “Services”).</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”). You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.</p>
<h3 id="1-whos-who">1. Who’s Who</h3>
<p>“You” means any individual or entity using our Services. If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using our Services you’re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.</p>
<p>We refer to Entertrained.app operated by Appstrakcja Maciej Caderek as “Entertrained,” “us,” or “we” throughout these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="2-your-account">2. Your Account</h3>
<p>When using our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information and to keep the information current so that we can communicate with you about your account. We may need to send you emails about notable updates (like changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or to let you know about legal inquiries or complaints we receive about the ways you use our Services so you can make informed choices in response.</p>
<p>We may limit your access to our Services until we’re able to verify your account information, like your email address.</p>
<p>When you create a Entertrained.app account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may also contact you to share more details about what we have to offer (i.e., marketing). Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested, you can opt out of the marketing communications.</p>
<p>You’re solely responsible and liable for all activity under your account. You’re also fully responsible for maintaining the security of your account (which includes keeping your password secure). We’re not liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of your acts or omissions.</p>
<p>Don’t share or misuse your access credentials. And notify us immediately of any unauthorized uses of your account, or of any other breach of security. If we believe your account has been compromised, we may suspend or disable it.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="3-minimum-age-requirements">3. Minimum Age Requirements</h3>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if you’re under the age of 13 (or 16 in Europe). If you register as a user or otherwise use our Services, you represent that you’re at least 13 (or 16 in Europe). You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if you’re under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.</p>
<h3 id="4-responsibility-of-visitors-and-users">4. Responsibility of Visitors and Users</h3>
<p>We haven’t reviewed, and can’t review, all of the content (like text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, and other materials) posted to or made available through our Services by users or anyone else (”Content”) or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We’re not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites. So, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t have any control over third-party websites.</li>
<li>A link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse any third-party website.</li>
<li>We don’t endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or not harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights of third parties.</li>
<li>We aren’t responsible for any harm resulting from anyone’s access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites. You’re responsible for taking the necessary precautions to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.</li>
<li>We are not a party to, and will have no responsibility or liability for, any communications, transactions, interactions, or disputes between you and the provider of any Content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, purchase, or use.</p>
<h3 id="5-fees-payment-and-renewal">5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h3>
<p><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like certain <a href="https://entertrained.app/pricing/">Entertrained.app plans</a> (collectively, “Paid Services”). This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.</p>
<p>By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be different kinds of fees, like some that are one-time, or recurring. For recurring fees (AKA subscriptions), your subscription begins on your purchase date, and we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, or annually) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time in your <a href="https://entertrained.app/profile">Profile</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (”Taxes”). You’re responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you’ve paid or will pay, you’re responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment from you.</p>
<p><strong>Payment.</strong> You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By providing your payment information, you authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we can’t charge your primary payment method.</p>
<p>**Automatic Renewal. **By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees and Taxes for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a subscription, it’ll automatically renew and we’ll charge your payment method(s). You must cancel at least one month before the scheduled end date of any annual subscription and at least 24 hours before the end of any shorter subscription period. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If you’ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.</p>
<p>You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions in your <a href="https://entertrained.app/profile">Profile</a> or by contacting the support team.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds.</strong> We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we’ll also provide refunds if required by law. In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>
<p>We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your participation. This means that if you don’t show up for, don’t participate in, or are late for a scheduled session, you’ll still be charged for the Paid Service and won’t be entitled to a refund.</p>
<p><em>European Users:</em></p>
<p>You have the right to withdraw from the transaction within fourteen (14) days from the date of the purchase without giving any reason as long as your purchase was not of downloadable content or of a customized nature, and (i) the service has not been fully performed, or (ii) subject to other limitations as permitted by law. For digital content, you agree that any purchase of digital content will be made available to you immediately and as a result you waive any right of withdrawal to such content.</p>
<p>If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse you all payments we have received from you, including delivery costs (with the exception of additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a type of delivery other than the most favorable standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we received the notification of your cancellation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; you will not be charged for this repayment. If we have already begun our services during the withdrawal period, you will pay us a prorated amount corresponding to the services already provided up to the time you notify us of the exercise of the withdrawal right compared to the total scope of the services provided for in the contract. If you cancel your contract with us, you will refrain from using the digital content or digital services or making them available to third parties.</p>
<p>You may exercise your right to withdrawal by sending a clear, written request to <a href="mailto:support@entertrained.app">support@entertrained.app</a>.</p>
<h3 id="6-feedback">6. Feedback</h3>
<p>We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Service. When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we’re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.</p>

<h4 id="a-entertrainedapp-websites-and-accounts">a. Entertrained.app Websites and Accounts</h4>
<p><a href="https://entertrained.app/">Entertrained.app</a> offers a unique platform for practicing touch typing through engaging literary content and various typing exercises. We would love for you to use it to improve your typing skills. An Entertrained.app account may also allow you to sign into some of our other services.</p>
<!--done-->

<p>Entertrained.app’s basic service is free, and we offer <a href="https://entertrained.app/pricing/">paid plans</a> that add advanced features like a access to the full library of books, upload of custom texts, detailed statistics, extra storage, and access to premium themes.</p>
<!--We don’t own your content, and you retain all ownership rights you have in the content you post to our website. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that nothing prohibited (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appears on your website.-->

<!--**License.** By uploading or sharing Content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, adapt, publicly display, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving our products and Services and promoting your website. This license also allows us to make any publicly-posted Content available to select third parties (through [Firehose](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/firehose/), for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services. You also give other Entertrained.app users permission to share your Content on other Entertrained.app websites and add their own Content to it (aka to “reblog” your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website, which the [reblogging](https://en.support.wordpress.com/reblogs/) function on Entertrained.app does automatically.-->

<p><strong>Removing Content.</strong> If you delete Content, we’ll use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on Entertrained.app, but you acknowledge that cached versions of the Content or references to the Content may not be immediately unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Web Traffic.</strong> We may use a third-party service to measure Entertrained.app’s audience and usage.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> Your Content and conduct must not violate the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/">Entertrained.app User Guidelines,</a> or the <a href="https://videopress.com/service-guidelines">VideoPress Service Guidelines</a> if you use our Services to upload videos. These guidelines provide information on a few categories of content and behavior that we don’t permit because we consider them harmful to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisements.</strong> We may display advertisements on your website and domain unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.</p>
<p><strong>Attribution.</strong> We may display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, noting that your website is powered by Entertrained.app or attributing the creator of your theme, for example. For more details about these attributions, and under which circumstances (if any) you may alter or remove them, please see our <a href="https://wordpress.com/support/footer-credits/">Footer Credit Options support page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="b-artificial-intelligence">b. Artificial Intelligence</h4>
<p>We may offer features that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI), that enable you to use AI to generate content for your typing practice.</p>
<p>As between you and Entertrained, and to the extent permitted by law, you own or have the rights to any content you input into AI features (”Input”) and any content generated by the AI features (”Output”).</p>
<p>You’re responsible for your Input, the use of any Output, and for complying with any applicable laws. AI may occasionally generate Output that’s inaccurate, irrelevant, offensive, harmful, or similar to others’ content.</p>
<!--Please see our [AI Guidelines](https://entertrained.app/ai-guidelines) for the policies you must comply with when you use AI features, details about the third-party providers we use to provide AI features, and helpful information about AI generally.-->

<p>The Agreement doesn’t transfer any Entertrained or third-party intellectual property to you, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property remains (as between Entertrained and you) solely with Entertrained. Entertrained, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our websites or Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Entertrained (or Entertrained’s licensors). Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties.

Using our Services doesn’t grant you any right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Entertrained or third-party trademarks, except for our <a href="https://entertrained.app/media-pack">Media Pack</a> for creators, which includes a separate license.</p>
<h3 id="11-third-party-services">11. Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>While using the Services, you may enable, use, or purchase services, products, software, embeds, or applications provided or manufactured by a third party (”Third-Party Services”). Certain Third-Party Services will indicate that they are sold or licensed by Entertrained with support provided by Entertrained.</p>
<p>If you use any Third-Party Services, you understand and agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-Party Services aren’t vetted, endorsed, or controlled by Entertrained.</li>
<li>Unless we have indicated that Entertrained is providing support for it, any use of a Third-Party Service is at your own risk, and we won’t be responsible or liable to you or anyone else for Third-Party Services.</li>
<li>Some Third-Party Services may request or require access to your data — or to your visitors’ or customers’ data — through things like pixels or cookies. If you use the Third-Party Service or grant them access, the data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices, which you should carefully review before you use any Third-Party Services. Third-Party Services may not work appropriately with our Services and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third-Party Services.</li>
<li>If you have questions or concerns about how a Third-Party Service operates or need support, contact the Third Party directly unless it is indicated that Entertrained provides support for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In rare cases we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third-Party Services from your account or website.</p>
<h3 id="12-changes">12. Changes</h3>
<p>We may modify the Terms from time to time, for example, to reflect changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we’ll provide notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and updating the “Last Updated” date or, if the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis, and, unless we say otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. By continuing to use our Services after we’ve notified you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to object to any changes at any time by ceasing your use of our Services and canceling any subscription you have.</p>
<h3 id="13-termination">13. Termination</h3>
<p>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause or notice, effective immediately, including if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement, any service guidelines, or other applicable terms. We have the right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim your username due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any part of this Agreement or any Entertrained policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make adjustments, or terminate your access to the Services, if we believe your account’s storage or bandwidth usage burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a user account is used for automated requests), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.</p>
<p>You can stop using our Services at any time, or, if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.</p>
<h3 id="14-disclaimers">14. Disclaimers</h3>
<p>Our Services are provided “as is.” Entertrained and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither Entertrained, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</p>
<h3 id="15-jurisdiction-and-applicable-law">15. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.</h3>
<p>Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of Poland, with national laws taking precedence, and the laws of the European Union where applicable, excluding its conflict of law provisions and the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be the courts located in Poland. Nothing in this Agreement affects your rights as a consumer to rely on mandatory provisions in your country of residence.</p>
<h3 id="16-limitation-of-liability">16. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>In no event will Entertrained, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable (including for any third-party products or services purchased or used through our Services) with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to Entertrained under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. Entertrained shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in Europe, we limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Entertrained isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, or our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. You and we agree that we and our affiliates’ total liability is limited to the greater of $50 or the amount paid by you to use our Services during the 12 months preceding the claim; To the extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our employees, legal representatives, and vicarious agents.</p>
<h3 id="17-indemnification">17. Indemnification</h3>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Entertrained, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services or applicable law, Content that you post, and any other activities conducted through your account.</p>
<h3 id="18-translation">18. Translation</h3>
<p>These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</p>
<h3 id="19-miscellaneous">19. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Entertrained and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.</p>
<p>Entertrained may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.</p>
